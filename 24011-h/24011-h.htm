<h2><a name="ZODIAC_TOWN" id="ZODIAC_TOWN"></a>ZODIAC TOWN</h2>


<p style="margin-left: 20%;">Amos and Ann had a poem to learn,<br />
    A poem to learn one day;<br />
    But alas! they sighed, and alack! they cried,<br />
    &#8217;Twere better to go and play.<br />
    Ann was sure &#8217;twas a waste of time<br />
    To bother a child with jingling rhyme.<br />
    Amos said, &ldquo;What&#8217;s the sense in rhythm&mdash;<br />
    Feet and lines?&rdquo; He had finished with &#8217;em!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">They peered at the poem with scowly faces,<br />
    And yawned and stumbled and lost their places.<br />
    Then&mdash;a breeze romped by, and a bluebird sang,<br />
    And they shut the book with a snap and a bang;<br />
    Shut the book and were off and away,<br />
    Away on flying feet;&mdash;<br />
    Never did squirrels move more light,<br />
    Or rabbits run more fleet!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">Over a wall and down a lane<br />
    And through a field they ran;<br />
    And &ldquo;Where shall we go?&rdquo; said Amos. &ldquo;Oh,<br />
    And where shall we stop?&rdquo; cried Ann.<br />
    Then all at once, round the curve of a hill,<br />
    They pulled up panting and stood stock-still;<br />
    For there, by the edge of a ripplety brook,<br />
    In a deep little, steep little place,<br />
    Sat a long-legged youth, with a staff and a book<br />
    And a quaint, very quizzical face.<br />
    His cap and his trousers were dusty green<br />
    And his jacket was rusty brown,<br />
    And he whittled away on sweet white wood,<br />
    With shavings showering down.<br />
    He whittled away &#8217;twixt a laugh and a tune,<br />
    With fingers as light as thistles.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">&ldquo;And what are you making?&rdquo; asked Amos and Ann.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">He said, &ldquo;I am making whistles.&rdquo;<br />
    He finished one with a notch and a slit,<br />
    And threw back his head and blew on it.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">The whistle sang like a bird when he blew,<br />
    Then he twinkled and put it down.<br />
    &ldquo;And where are you going,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you two?<br />
    <em>Are you going to Zodiac Town</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">Each of them shook a doubtful head<br />
    (For truly they didn&#8217;t know).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">&ldquo;But make us a whistle like yours,&rdquo; they said,<br />
    &ldquo;And anywhere we will go!&rdquo;<br />
    &ldquo;I&#8217;ll make you a whistle apiece,&rdquo; quoth he,<br />
    &ldquo;And if you like, you may follow me;<br />
    Zodiac Town&#8217;s in the land of Time,<br />
    And I go by the road of Rhyme.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">Ann looked at Amos and Amos at Ann;<br />
    They blinked with sheer surprise;<br />
    And then they looked at the long-legged man,<br />
    Who twinkled back with his eyes.<br />
    They said (and their voices were meek and low),<br />
    &ldquo;We ran away from a rhyme, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; cried the fellow in green and brown.<br />
    &ldquo;Then it&#8217;s unmistakably plain, oho,<br />
    That you&#8217;re due in Zodiac Town!&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">He took up his book and shouldered his staff,<br />
    And turned to Amos and Ann.<br />
    &ldquo;Call me J. M.,&rdquo; he said with a laugh.<br />
    &ldquo;That stands for Journeying Man.<br />
    I&#8217;ll make you some whistles along the way,<br />
    While you are remembering rhymes to say;<br />
    For more than once in the land of Time<br />
    You will have to speak in rhyme.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">&ldquo;Our names,&rdquo; said the children, &ldquo;are Amos and Ann;<br />
    And poetry is rather hard for us,<br />
    But we&#8217;ll do the best we can.&rdquo;<br />
    Then they went away with the young-faced man,<br />
    Joyfully up and down,<br />
    Talking in rhyme by hill and lea,<br />
    Gayly in rhyme&mdash;for that, said he,<br />
    Was the tongue of Zodiac Town.<br />
    To Zodiac after a while they came&mdash;<br />
    The twistiest, mistiest town,<br />
    With odd little collopy, scallopy streets<br />
    Meandering up and down.<br />
    The home of the years and the hours was there,<br />
    Of the minutes, the months, and the days&mdash;<br />
    Houses with windows that winked and smiled,<br />
    And doors with sociable ways;<br />
    And leaves and apples and chestnuts brown<br />
    Came pattering down, came clattering down,<br />
    And stairways wound to the top of a hill<br />
    That a person could climb if he had the will&mdash;<br />
    That a person could climb, then start at the top,<br />
    And bumpeting down and thumpeting down,<br />
    Go zip! to the bottom with never a stop.</p>

 <p style="margin-left: 20%;">&ldquo;<em>Whoopee!</em>&rdquo; cried Amos&mdash;and off and away,<br />
    Quick with a kick, like a clown,<br />
    He ran to the top of the highest stair,<br />
    Ann at his heels&mdash;And zip! the pair<br />
    Came bumpeting down and thumpeting down.<br />
    Then, &ldquo;Come, you two,&rdquo; said the Journeying Man,<br />
    &ldquo;We have twelve calls to pay.<br />
    We&#8217;ll visit the months this time, if we can.<br />
    Now listen to me: at every house<br />
    Many clocks will be ticking away:<br />
    Grandfather clocks and cuckoo clocks<br />
    And moon-faced clocks on shelves,<br />
    Clocks with alarms and eight-day clocks,<br />
    All talking low to themselves;<br />
    Little gilt clocks and clocks with chimes,<br />
    And all of them keeping different times.<br />
    And any minute of any hour<br />
    (You never did see their like),<br />
    Evening or morning, with never a warning,<br />
    One of the lot will strike.<br />
    And you <em>may</em> be talking your everyday talk,<br />
    But the instant the hour shall chime,<br />
    Quick as a flash you must stop, and dash<br />
    Right into a rollicking rhyme!&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">&ldquo;What kind of a rhyme?&rdquo; gasped Amos and Ann.<br />
    &ldquo;What kind of a rhyme, J. M.?&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 20%;">&ldquo;Any kind at all,&rdquo; said the Journeying Man,<br />
    As he twinkled his eyes at them.<br />
    &ldquo;But it must begin with the very two sounds,<br />
    (Or three or four, if you like,)<br />
    <em>The last few sounds that were on your tongue</em><br />
    <em>When the clock began to strike</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 33%;"><em>They went to the January house,</em><br />
    <em>A house made all of snow,</em><br />
    <em>With windows of ice, and chandeliers</em><br />
    <em>Of icicles all in a row.</em><br />
    <em>The trim young master was dressed in fur</em><br />
    <em>And didn&#8217;t seem cold at all&mdash;</em><br />
    <em>A red-cheeked, rollicking, frolicking chap,</em><br />
    <em>Who offered each caller an ermine wrap,</em><br />
    <em>And let them skate in his hall.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 11]</span></p>
<p>While they were skating round the hall, Amos&#8217;s feet flew from under him
and he sat down hard on the ice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you break anything?&rdquo; asked the January boy. &ldquo;I hope not, indeed,&rdquo; he
added earnestly, &ldquo;because so many things are broken here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of things?&rdquo; Amos wanted to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mainly resolutions,&rdquo; answered January with a wry face. And then he
further said: &ldquo;So many of <em>them</em> get broken that sometimes I think I&#8217;ll
move into another house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; put in little Ann, &ldquo;we shouldn&#8217;t have any New Year. And oh,
how we&#8217;d miss New Year&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A square-faced clock on the hall-landing struck one just as Ann said she&#8217;d
miss New Year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Ann with a gasp. &ldquo;Now I&#8217;ve got to say a rhyme beginning&mdash;&lsquo;miss
New Year.&rsquo; What shall I say?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss New Year, miss New Year&mdash;&rdquo; Then all at once, to her intense
surprise, she found herself reciting:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Miss New Year dressed herself in white,</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">With crystal buttons shining,</span><br />
    <span class="poem1">A spangled scarf, all lacy-light</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">About her shoulders twining;</span><br />
    <span class="poem1">A bunch of pearly mistletoe,</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">A twig of ruddy holly,</span><br />
    <span class="poem1">She tucked among her curls, and oh,</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">She was so sweet and jolly!</span></p>

<p><span class="poem">&ldquo;She tapped upon my window-pane</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">And waked me, bright and early.</span><br />
    <span class="poem1">&lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;the sun&#8217;s outside,</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">The winds are gay and whirly!</span><br />
    <span class="poem1">&#8217;Neath winter frost and summer sky,</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">In spring or autumn weather,</span><br />
    <span class="poem1">Come out, dear child, and you and I</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">Will be good chums together!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>J. M. was the next one to get caught. January had just asked the three to
stay to lunch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish we could,&rdquo; said the Journeying Man, &ldquo;but in spite of all these
clocks there is no time. I can smell your stew cooking, January&mdash;, such
stew!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A clock struck eight just as the Journeying Man said &ldquo;such stew.&rdquo; Without
hesitation he went on:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p><span class="poem">&ldquo;&lsquo;Such stupid days!&rsquo; said Willie Green</span><br />
    <span class="poem1">With long and doleful face.</span><br />
    <span class="poem1">&lsquo;Suppose to-night the whirling globe</span><br />

<p>January grinned. &ldquo;It would have to be a cold kind of pet,&rdquo; he replied.

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 21]</span></p>
<p>The little valentine girl in the February house was very sociable; but she
talked so much, and there were so many clocks striking all around, that
she was always getting side-tracked into a rhyme.</p>

<p>For example, she was just about to describe a jolly party she went to one
day last year, when a clock struck six, and she was obliged to say,
instead:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;One day last year, with hems and haws and sidelong steps and
nervous caws, the crows came mincing forth to mail gay valentines,
you know. The post box was a hollow tree. They did not know,
unluckily, that squirrels had gnawed the floor away, and owls moved
in below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The crows went flapping off with glee. They said, &lsquo;Our woodland
friends will see that, though we dress so solemnly, we&#8217;re sociable
at heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The valentines came hurrying down, came scurrying down, came
flurrying down, and waked the owls, all fast asleep, and gave them
quite a start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What&#8217;s this, my dear, amiss, my dear?&rsquo; cried Father Owl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, bliss, my dear,&rsquo; said Mrs. Owl. &lsquo;A shower of mail for us. How
very fine!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The daughter owls were full of joy, and quick the little owlet boy
ruffed up his feathers roguishly and seized a valentine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excitement reigned among those owls; but, being such nocturnal
fowls, they could not read the valentines at all in broad
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 22]</span>
daylight. They blinked a bit and winked a bit, but found them not
distinct a bit; then did not go to bed again, but waited for the
night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just after dusk a thing occurred, unfortunate for every bird: a
wild, wild wind came romping in (it was a dreadful prank), and with
a swoop, in boisterous play, swept all the envelopes away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor owls cried, &lsquo;Alackaday, we shan&#8217;t know whom to thank!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next morning all the crows came out and pranced about and glanced
about, expecting greetings from their friends, and praise, and
everything; but when they got no single word of gratitude from any
bird, they held a meeting in the trees that made the whole woods
ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it surely seemed a shame, but no one really was to
blame; and this year all the birds around (I heard it from a wren)
will put their mail most carefully safe in a holeproof hollow tree.
And every crow is going to be a happy crow again!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Little Ann was enchanted with the February house; she planned in her own
mind to copy it in chocolate and taffy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;d like to see upstairs,&mdash;the beds and bureaus and things,&mdash;&rdquo; she said
shyly, &ldquo;if you don&#8217;t mind my looking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A big clock began to boom somewhere near.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 23]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My looking&mdash;&rdquo; repeated Ann. &ldquo;Dear me suz, I&#8217;m caught again! What shall I
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then all at once she said:&mdash;</p>

<p> <span class="poem">&ldquo;My looking-glass is like a pool,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">As still and clear, as blank and cool.</span></p>

<p> <span class="poem">&ldquo;It fronts the clean white nursery wall,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">With no look on its face at all.</span></p>

<p> <span class="poem">&ldquo;But when in front of it I go,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Why, there I am, from top to toe.</span></p>

<p> <span class="poem">&ldquo;Oh, just suppose I hurried there</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Some day to brush my tousled hair,</span></p>

<p> <span class="poem">&ldquo;And stood and stared, and could not see</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">One single, single sign of me!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>When it was nearly time to leave the February house, Ann remarked that
Amos had talked in prose straight along ever since they came.</p>

<p>Amos smiled proudly. &ldquo;So I have,&rdquo; he said. He was about to go on to say
that he wondered if he would be caught at all, when&mdash;whiz! with a scramble
and a scuffle a cuckoo rushed out of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> clock just above his head and
bobbed intently up and down twelve times. Amos had got only as far as
&ldquo;wonder.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wonder&mdash;wonder&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered, as he heard the clock.
&ldquo;Wonder&mdash;wonder&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 31]</span></p>
<p>Amos and Ann were very curious to know why the twins lived in a tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it saves time,&rdquo; the black-haired twin explained. &ldquo;There are one or
two days in the year when we&#8217;re bound to be up here anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the yellow-haired twin, &ldquo;we never have the slightest idea
how March is going to come in. If he comes in like a lion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, of course, you want to be out of the way,&rdquo; interrupted Ann,
delighted with herself for knowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the twin. &ldquo;And if he comes in like a lamb, then we know
how he&#8217;s going out, of course. So we simply get up here and stay. Listen
to our song.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they sang in duet:</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;When March comes in roaring, growling,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Winds swoop over the hilltop howling;</span><br />

        <span class="poem3">Fierce and furious, he&mdash;</span></p>

     <p><span class="poem1">But he&#8217;s going out like a lamb;</span><br />
        <span class="poem3">You watch and see!</span></p>

     <span class="poem1">Short and white as a lambkin&#8217;s tail;</span><br />

     <span class="poem1">Mighty switchy and sweet, and all that&mdash;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">But he&#8217;s going out like a lion.</span><br />
        <span class="poem3"><em>Hold on to your hat</em>!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s not a single solitary clock at this place, anyway,&rdquo; Amos
remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t be too sure,&rdquo; J. M. told him. &ldquo;It may be, you see, that the tree
keeps a clock in its trunk. First thing you know, the clock may speak up
and tell on itself, the way Tom Tuttle used to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We never heard of Tom Tuttle,&rdquo; said little Ann.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never heard of Tom Tuttle?&rdquo; echoed the Journeying Man. &ldquo;Then you shall
hear of him, as soon as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>From a hole in the tree came the sound of a clock
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 33]</span> striking loudly. J. M.
was bound to go on, then, just as he had begun, and so he said:&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;As soon as ever spring drew near, and brooks and winds were loose,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">Tom Tuttle would be late to school with never an excuse.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;So little and so very late! And when the teacher said</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">That he must take his punishment, he merely hung his head.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;She&#8217;d ask him all the hardest things in all the hardest books;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">And queerly he would answer her, with absent-minded looks.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;&lsquo;How many yards make twenty rods?&rsquo; And Tommy said, &lsquo;Oh, dear,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">Twelve rods I&#8217;ve cut for fishing poles in our own yard this year.&rsquo;</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;&lsquo;How many perches make a mile? Now think before you speak.&rsquo;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">&lsquo;Perches?&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;There&#8217;s millions in the upper sawmill creek.&rsquo;</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;&lsquo;What grows in southern Hindustan?&rsquo; Said Tom, &lsquo;I do not know;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">But I can take you to a tree where blackheart cherries grow.&rsquo;</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;&lsquo;Name Christopher Columbus&#8217;s boats.&rsquo; &lsquo;I can&#8217;t remember, quite;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">But mine, that lies below the falls, is named the Water Sprite.&rsquo;</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;&lsquo;Now what is &ldquo;whistle&rdquo;&mdash;noun or verb?&rsquo; &lsquo;I do not know indeed;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">But just the other day I made a whistle from a reed.&rsquo;</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;Then all the little listening boys would wiggle in their places,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">And all the little watching girls would have to hide their faces;</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;And, &lsquo;Thomas, Thomas!&rsquo; teacher&#8217;d say, and shake her head in doubt,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">And make him write a hundred words before the day was out.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;&#8217;T was always so when grass turned green and blue was in the sky&mdash;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">Tom Tuttle coming late to school and never telling why.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>They had a good laugh at Tom Tuttle; but presently the thoughts of Amos
turned to March hares.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they ever come near enough for you to touch them?&rdquo; he asked the twins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, March hares are very timid,&rdquo; the twins said. &ldquo;They are terribly
afraid of meeting the March lion at a sudden corner,&rdquo; the yellow-haired
twin added. &ldquo;That is on their minds a great deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very best way to get close to a March hare,&rdquo; said the black-haired
boy, &ldquo;is to take a reserved seat at the annual March-hare ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 35]</span></p>
<p>Then the two brothers told this tale; and Amos and Ann saw no reason for
not believing it:&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Maybe nobody&#8217;s told you</span><br />

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Harum-scarum and happy,</span><br />

<p>This is the April poem that the Journeying Man recited for the rest:&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Young Peter Puck and his brothers wrote</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">To the wise wood-people a little note.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">It said, &lsquo;If you&#8217;ll meet us by Ripply Pond,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Wonders we&#8217;ll show with our magic wand.&rsquo;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">&lsquo;What shall we do?&rsquo; said the forest-folk.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">&lsquo;Maybe it&#8217;s merely a practical joke.&rsquo;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">But they went, good souls, and they only found</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">A bare, bare bush and the green, green ground.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">&lsquo;But watch,&rsquo; said the fairies, &lsquo;and you shall see</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Animals grow on a tiny tree.&rsquo;</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;The rabbits and squirrels felt aggrieved;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">They thought that surely they&#8217;d been deceived.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">But Peter Puck, at the head of the band,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Called, &lsquo;Come, come, Kitty!&rsquo; and waved his hand.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Then the buds on the pussy-willow bush</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">All became kittens as soft as plush&mdash;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Smooth, round kittens, quite calm and fat;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">On every twig hung a little cat.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And the fairies danced, and the glad wood-folk</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Cried, &lsquo;Oh, what a beautiful, beautiful joke!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look here,&rdquo; said the April Fool, when J. M. was done. &ldquo;I have several
important questions to ask this crowd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then proceeded to ask the questions, not one of which anyone even tried
to answer.</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Now, speech is very curious:</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">You never know what minute</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">A word will show a brand-new side,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">With brand-new meaning in it.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">This world could hardly turn around,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">If some things acted like they sound.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Suppose the April flower-beds,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Down in the garden spaces,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Were made with green frog-blanket spreads</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And caterpillar-cases;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Or oak trees locked their trunks to hide</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">The countless rings they keep inside!</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Suppose from every pitcher-plant</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">The milk-weed came a-pouring;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">That tiger-lilies could be heard</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">With dandelions roaring,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Till all the cat-tails, far and near,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Began to bristle up in fear!</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;What if the old cow blew her horn</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Some peaceful evening hour,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And suddenly a blast replied</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">From every trumpet-flower,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">While people&#8217;s ears beat noisy drums</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">To &lsquo;Hail, the Conquering Hero Comes!&rsquo;</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;If barn-yard fowls had honey-combs,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">What should we think, I wonder?</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">If lightning-bugs should swiftly strike,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Then peal with awful thunder?</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And would it turn our pink cheeks pale</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">To see a comet switch its tail?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The queer little fellow did not seem to be at all disturbed by the failure
of the company to answer his questions. He turned courteously to little
Ann.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 45]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s your turn to ask a riddle, you know,&rdquo; he reminded her.</p>

<p>To little Ann&#8217;s astonishment a riddle popped right into her head&mdash;a rhymed
riddle, at that!</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Busy Mistress One-Eye</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">With her long white train</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Dips her nose and down she goes&mdash;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Up she comes again.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Not a hand and not a foot;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Has no need for those;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Makes her trip without a slip,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Following her nose.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Two she has to guide her:</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">One, a sturdy chap,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Other, tall beside her,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">In a silver cap.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;As she moves&mdash;how funny!</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Yet it&#8217;s very plain&mdash;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Brighter grows her one eye</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And shorter grows her train.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what&#8217;s the answer?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s easy,&rdquo; the Fool said promptly. &ldquo;The answer is, of course, a
mushroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 46]</span></p>
<p>Amos laughed loudly at that; but kind little Ann was distressed to think
what a pitifully poor guess her host had made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not a mushroom, Mr. Fool,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t you see it has something
to do with sewing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then of course it&#8217;s a mushroom,&rdquo; the Fool said calmly. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t I sow
mushrooms every year all over my backyard? Nobody can fool me,&rdquo; he
finished with a chuckle, &ldquo;about mushrooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And after that naturally there was nothing more to be said.</p>

<p>The children were very reluctant to leave the April house; but J. M.
glanced at one of the many topsy-turvy clocks that hung from the ceiling
(of all places!), and reminded them that it was high time to be moving
on.</p>

<p>The Journeying Man swept off his green hat when he caught sight of May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you&#8217;d be here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May I tell my two young companions how
the joyful animals welcomed you when you came?&rdquo;</p>

<p>May smiled at Amos and Ann. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; she asked J. M.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw it all,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I was passing through the wood one day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Journeying Man was interrupted here by a clock striking ten, and so he
was obliged to dash into rhyme:&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;One day the cheery wood-folk heard</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">A robin tell another bird</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">A piece of news, a joyful word</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Repeated often over.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">&lsquo;Oho,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;we&#8217;ll plan a way</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">To welcome back our pretty May.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">We&#8217;ll have a celebration day</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">To show her how we love her.&rsquo;</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Professor Bear should speak, they planned,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">With Dr. Fox upon the stand;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">The bird quintette from Mapleville</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
     <span class="poem1">Would sing its loveliest;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And Mr. Owl, the baritone,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Should give selections of his own;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And all the rabbit girls and boys</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Should wear their very best.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;The day was fair with balmy air,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And banners waving everywhere;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">The woolliest lamb, all curled and frilled,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Was sent to meet the guest;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And even little rats and things,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And creatures that had only wings,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Were given tiny parts to play,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And waited with the rest.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Then, tripping light and skipping light</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And laughing clear, a happy sight,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And flinging flowers left and right,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Came merry, merry May.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">&lsquo;Oh, welcome, welcome home!&rsquo; they cried;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">The banners dipped on every side.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">She curtsied low, &lsquo;Just think,&rsquo; she said,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">&lsquo;I have a month to stay!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>


<p>May looked as pleased as Amos and Ann when the rhyme was finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s every word true,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And here&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'>
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> some more news that the
little bird told&mdash;if you&#8217;d like to hear it:&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;Miss Butterfly sent word one day to all the garden people</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">That she would give a social tea beneath the hollyhock.</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">A robin read the message from a slender pine-tree steeple&mdash;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">A note that begged them sweetly to be there by six o&#8217;clock.</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">They came a-wing, they came a-foot, they came from flower and thicket;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">Miss Hummingbird was present in a coat and bonnet gay,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">And portly Mr. Bumblebee and cheerful Mr. Cricket,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">And tiny Mrs. Ladybug in polka-dot array.</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">There were seats for four-and-twenty, and the guest of honor there</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">Was a gray Granddaddy-long-legs in a little mushroom chair.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;The table was a toadstool with a spider-woven cover;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">The fare was served in rose-leaf plates and bluebell cups a-ring&mdash;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">Sweet honey from the latest bloom, and last night&#8217;s dew left over,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">And a crumb of mortal cake for which an ant went pilfering.</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">A mockingbird within the hedge sang loudly for their revel;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">A lily swayed above them, slow, to keep the moths away;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">So they laughed and buzzed and chattered till the shadows lengthened level,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">And Miss Katydid said sadly that she must no longer stay.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
     <span class="poem5">Then all arose and shook their wings, and curtsied, every one,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">&lsquo;Good-night, good-bye, Miss Butterfly, we never had such fun.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Little Ann looked wistful when she heard all the butterfly tale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do wish I might go to a party like that,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>Amos reflected. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t know but what I&#8217;d be afraid of stepping on the
guests,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s true,&rdquo; Ann agreed. &ldquo;Just think how it would seem to have Miss
Butterfly say to you, &lsquo;Oh, you&#8217;ve crushed Mrs. Ant,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Excuse me, but
you seem to be sitting on Colonel Grasshopper, Sir.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell you what <em>I</em> wish,&rdquo; Amos went on. &ldquo;I wish&mdash;Oh, there goes a clock&mdash;I
wish&mdash;I wish&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;I wish, when summer&#8217;s drawing near about the end of May,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">With bees and birds and other things, that teacher&#8217;d teach this way:</span></p>

<p>It was so cool and delightful at the June house that at first the
travelers didn&#8217;t have much to say&mdash;they simply sat and rested and looked
around. But presently Ann began to feel lively again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No clocks here, anyway!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>The gypsy rolled his black eyes. He had a clock, he said, but it ran too
fast. &ldquo;In fact it ran down,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; asked little Ann.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I tell?&rdquo; returned the gypsy chap. &ldquo;It ran down, you know&mdash;down
into the woods. And since it runs so fast, I didn&#8217;t even try to overtake
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But a clock has no feet,&rdquo; cried Amos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has hands, though,&rdquo; retorted the gypsy. &ldquo;Will you deny that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he pointed his funny brown finger at Ann. &ldquo;You can make a rhyme
without a clock striking, you know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Make one, this minute,
Miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ann was alarmed. &ldquo;What shall I make it about?&rdquo; she said in a flustered
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything,&rdquo; the gypsy answered. &ldquo;Hats will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hats?&rdquo; echoed Ann. &ldquo;However in the world can I make a poem about hats?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But all at once she did begin to make one; it ran along as smoothly as A B
C.</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;If hats were made of flowers,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">I think my party bonnet</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Would be a satin tulip</span><br />

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;I&#8217;d wear for fun and frolic</span><br />

     <span class="poem1">With a crown quite comfortable</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And a flaring yellow frill.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;I&#8217;d choose for church a beauty:</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">The sweetest flower that grows</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Would be my Sunday bonnet&mdash;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">A soft, pink, ruffled rose.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;A daisy crisp and snowy</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Would be the choice for school;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">A fresh hat every morning,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">With scallops starched and cool.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;For picnics and for rambles</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">A polished buttercup.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">If hats were made of flowers,</span><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>Just as Ann said the last word of her poem, an inquisitive thousand-leg
worm scuttled along the ground about a yard away, and she almost turned a
summersault.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&#8217;t think of hurting you,&rdquo; said the gypsy chap. &ldquo;Speaking of
hats, little Ann&mdash;did you ever hear the tale of the centipede lady and her
shoes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he told it.</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Little Miss Centipede</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">Went out to shop,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And at Shoofly &amp; Company&#8217;s</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">Made her first stop.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Mr. Shoofly came forward,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">All beaming and gay:</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">&lsquo;And what can I do for you,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">Madam, to-day?&rsquo;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">He bowed and he beckoned;</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">He showed her a seat;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">But the poor clerks turned pale</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">When she put out her feet.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">&lsquo;How many?&rsquo; they faltered.</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">&lsquo;As many as these,&rsquo;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">She replied very sweetly,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">&lsquo;And hurry up, please.&rsquo;</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;So they hurried and scurried,</span><br />

<p>By this time they had finished their stew. The Journeying Man rose and
picked up his staff. &ldquo;That was good soup,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The gypsy looked gratified. &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he <span class='pagenum'>

Contrary Mary&#8217;s truck in it, and maybe it didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m not saying as to
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amos and Ann were filled with curiosity. They wanted to know what
&ldquo;Contrary Mary&#8217;s truck&rdquo; might be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You tell them,&rdquo; the gypsy said to the Journeying Man. And J. M. did.</p>

<p>At first Amos and Ann stood a little in awe of the old man in the July
house; but he looked so jolly and friendly, and J. M. seemed to know him
so well, that they were soon set at ease.</p>

<p>Little Ann made bold to ask him a question. &ldquo;Do you remember the American
Revolution?&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sakes alive, Ann!&rdquo; cried Amos, a good deal embarrassed.</p>

<p>But the old man did not seem at all offended. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered slowly,
&ldquo;I can tell you this much about it:</p>

        <p><span class="poem3">&ldquo;The little boys of &#8217;76&mdash;</span><br />
    <span class="poem">They did their chores and swam and fished,</span><br />
    <span class="poem">And hunted hares and whittled sticks,</span><br />
    <span class="poem">While all the time they wished and wished</span><br />
    <span class="poem">To hear a sudden summons come,</span><br />
    <span class="poem">Each waiting day, each listening night:</span><br />
    <span class="poem">&lsquo;We need the boys for flag and drum,</span><br />
        <span class="poem3">So send them to the fight!&rsquo;</span></p>

        <p><span class="poem3">&ldquo;The little girls of &#8217;76&mdash;</span><br />
    <span class="poem">They rocked their dollies to and fro,</span><br />
    <span class="poem">And taught the kittens pretty tricks,</span><br />
    <span class="poem">And heard their mothers talking low;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
    <span class="poem">Then climbed into the hayloft high,</span><br />
    <span class="poem">They peered through every glimmering crack,</span><br />
    <span class="poem">And longed to raise a joyful cry:</span><br />
        <span class="poem3">&lsquo;The men are marching back!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Amos was inclined to think that maybe Ann&#8217;s question hadn&#8217;t been such a
foolish one, after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he ventured, &ldquo;you knew my great-great-great-grandfather. Can
you tell me anything about him, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can tell you this,&rdquo; the old man said:&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Your great-great-great-grandfather</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">Was a little chap like you,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">When suddenly one summer</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">Bugles of battle blew,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And bells rang in the towers,</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">And flags at windows flew.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;He heard the tramp of horses</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">And the fall of marching feet;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">He saw a dust on the hill road,</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">Regiments in the street,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">While men were thick in the highway</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">And drums in the market beat.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;He watched how the townsfolk hurried</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">Eagerly to and fro;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">He heard the voice of his mother,</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">Quiet and brave and low;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And he saw his father shoulder</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">A queer old gun and go.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Your great-great-great-grandfather,</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">Sturdy and strong like you,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Glad of the blowing bugles,</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">Proud of the flags that flew,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Was glad and proud as you, lad&mdash;</span><br />
      <span class="poem2">Son of a soldier, too!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I <em>am</em> the son of a soldier!&rdquo; Amos cried, delighted. &ldquo;Though I don&#8217;t
know how you found it out, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Amos,&rdquo; the Journeying Man put in, &ldquo;it&#8217;s only fair that you should
give us your poem about a band.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amos turned red. &ldquo;My poem about a band!&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t know any poem
about a band.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three,&rdquo; chimed an old grandfather clock on the stairs; and all
at once the little boy, much to his astonishment, began to recite. This is
what he recited:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;A band is such a brave, bright thing,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">With tassels tossed, and burnished brass,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And music quick and fluttering&mdash;</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">I love to see one pass.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Sometimes it sounds for turning wheels,&mdash;</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">A circus coming into town,&mdash;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And then the tune gets in my heels</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">And shakes them up and down.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Sometimes it sounds for marching men,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">With cry of bugles in the street,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And fair flags blowing free&mdash;and then</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">I cannot hold my feet.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;I follow, follow on and on;</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">I let it lead me where it will;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">And when the last clear notes are gone,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">Somehow I hear them still.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The old man was plainly pleased with the verses; he told Amos that little
boys had always felt that way about bands, and probably always would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; he said, as the Journeying Man made the move to go. &ldquo;Did
the June fellow tell them the story of Contrary Mary?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; the children answered in duet. &ldquo;And oh, wasn&#8217;t she curious,
sure enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she had a right to be queer,&rdquo; the old man said meditatively. &ldquo;She
inherited queerness. Fact of the matter is, her family name was Queeribus.
Let me tell you about <em>her</em> great-great-great-grandfather!</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Old Quin Queeribus&mdash;</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">He loved his garden so,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">He wouldn&#8217;t have a rake around,</span><br />

       <span class="poem2">Fine spectacles of gold,</span><br />

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Amos persisted, &ldquo;if they don&#8217;t go to school, then how on earth did
they learn how to talk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I taught them, to be sure,&rdquo; said a hoarse voice overhead.</p>

<p>The children looked up, startled, and were astonished to see that the
voice came, apparently, from a long-tailed green parrot, with a hooked
beak and round, solemn eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They come from all parts of the world,&rdquo; the parrot resumed, &ldquo;for me to
teach them. Of course, you needn&#8217;t call it a school if you don&#8217;t want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He whistled shrilly, and the birds and beasts came scampering back and
stood round in a respectful circle. The children tried to talk to them,
but they looked bashful and would not say a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&#8217;d like to hear some rhymes,&rdquo; J. M. suggested. &ldquo;Go ahead,
Amos and Ann.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My <em>stars</em>!&rdquo; said Ann, and Amos added: &ldquo;How in the world can I start off
quite suddenly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then a cuckoo rushed out from a clock somewhere and cuckooed eleven
times, and the twelfth time Amos said:&mdash;</p>

       <span class="poem2">He&#8217;d scarcely so have trembled!</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;&lsquo;What ails you?&rsquo; asked a brother trout.</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">&lsquo;What&#8217;s wrong?&rsquo; inquired a minnow.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">&lsquo;Alas! We&#8217;re all invited out,&rsquo;</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">He shivered, &lsquo;to a dinner!&rsquo;</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;They cried, &lsquo;Why, that&#8217;s a jolly plan!</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">Who asked us out to dine?&rsquo;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; sobbed the trout, &lsquo;a fisherman,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">He just dropped me a line!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>When the poem was finished, the parrot cried, &ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; and clapped
his wings excitedly, and a little raccoon laughed so loud that he had to
be sent away in disgrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Ann,&rdquo; said J. M., &ldquo;give us a poem about your cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a wild cat, I hope,&rdquo; put in the parrot hastily. &ldquo;That kind of a cat
has such bad manners&mdash;far, far worse than the raccoon&#8217;s&mdash;that it is not
allowed round here at all. If it&#8217;s a polite kind of a cat, go on, Miss;
not otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Ann was very red in the face. &ldquo;But I can&#8217;t go on,&rdquo; she said. She
intended to say also, &ldquo;There&#8217;s nothing to go on with,&rdquo; but just as she
said &ldquo;There&#8217;s,&rdquo; a little nickel clock called five very clearly, and she
remarked, instead:&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;There&#8217;s the snow-white cat, the pearl-gray cat,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">The brindle and the brown,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">The cat with stripes around himself,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">The cat striped up and down,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">The plaid cat and the buff cat,</span><br />

     <span class="poem1">The bluish sort, the reddish sort&mdash;</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">More tints than I can tell.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">But the finest of the whole fine lot</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">(There&#8217;s no disputing that)</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">Is the jet-black chap with one white spot&mdash;</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">And that&#8217;s our kind of cat.</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;The tiny cat is cunning,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">The long, lean cat is fleet,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">The nimble one is made for fun,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">The fluff-ball one is sweet,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">The Persian pussy&#8217;s splendid,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">The Maltese kitty, too,</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">But the special kind I have in mind</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">Is best of all the crew.</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">He&#8217;s not too quick and frisky,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">Nor is he slow and fat;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">He&#8217;s soft and warm and fits my arm,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">And he&#8217;s our kind of cat!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Ann&#8217;s recitation was well received. The parrot said he was very familiar
with the kitty kind of cat&mdash;in fact, had instructed a good many of them.</p>

<p>Amos remarked that, with so many beasts coming to learn, the place would
soon be filled to overflowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the parrot. &ldquo;The same train that brings in a crowd takes a
crowd away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Train?</em>&rdquo; Amos repeated, his eyes round with curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure&mdash;train,&rdquo; the parrot answered. &ldquo;You don&#8217;t mean to tell me you
never heard of the Wild Beast Limited?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>Then he preened his feathers with pride and chanted the song of the Wild
Beast Limited.</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;The Wild Beast Limited pulls out</span><br />

    <em>A flag-pole stood in the yard,</em><br />

    <em>Was trampled bare and hard.</em><br />
    <em>A bell hung high in the little tower,</em><br />

    <em>They saw a young woman with pen in hand,</em><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>The young woman rose and came smilingly to the door. A clock somewhere
inside struck nine, with quick, sharp strokes.</p>

<p>It sounded so familiar, somehow, that the children cried in alarm, &ldquo;Oh,
it&#8217;s time for school!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite, for you scholars,&rdquo; the teacher said. &ldquo;But folks and things in
there&rdquo;&mdash;she nodded toward the schoolroom&mdash;&ldquo;are ready and waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amos and Ann peered past her through the door, but they could see nothing
except desks and seats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose Columbus has sailed, by this time,&rdquo; remarked the Journeying
Man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; the young woman replied. &ldquo;Furthermore, the Mississippi is
flowing into the Gulf of Mexico as hard as it can, and rice is growing in
Japan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children understood, now, and they were both laughing. &ldquo;Are the
prepositions and adverbs in their places?&rdquo; they asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Multiplication tables set, I suppose?&rdquo; said J. M.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; the teacher answered. &ldquo;And the tables of weights and
measures, too. And many things are here in addition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; asked little Ann, &ldquo;do the children in Zodiac Town know when it&#8217;s
time for school to open?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the way the children in any other town know,&rdquo; the teacher replied.</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;When bees and birds and butterflies</span><br />

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;When apples in the orchard lot</span><br />
       <span class="poem3">And pears come thumping, falling;</span><br />

      <span class="poem3">&lsquo;Time for school!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>A clock boomed ten with a familiar sound, and Ann and Amos jumped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost thought we were an hour late for school,&rdquo; Ann said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;September&#8217;s a rather funny month,&rdquo; Amos remarked. &ldquo;It ends so many things
and it begins so many things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like to come home at the end of summer,&rdquo; little Ann said. Then, without
waiting at all for a clock to strike she swung into a poem:&mdash;</p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;When we travel back in summer to the old house by the sea,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">Where long ago my mother lived, a little girl like me,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">I have the strangest notion that she still is waiting there,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">A small child in a pinafore with ribbon on her hair.</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">I hear her in the garden when I go to pick a rose;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">She follows me along the path on dancing tipsy-toes;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">I hear her in the hayloft when the hay is slippery-sweet&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
     <span class="poem5">A rustle and a scurry and a sound of scampering feet;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">Yet though I sit as still as still, she never comes to me,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">The funny little laughing girl my mother used to be.</span></p>

    <p><span class="poem4">&ldquo;Sometimes I nearly catch her as she dodges here and there,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">Her white dress flutters round a tree and flashes up a stair;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">Sometimes I almost put my hand upon her apron strings&mdash;</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">Then, just before my fingers close, she&#8217;s gone again like wings.</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">A sudden laugh, a scrap of song, a footfall on the lawn,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">And yet, no matter how I run, forever up and gone!</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">A fairy or a firefly could hardly flit so fast.</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">When we come home in summer, I have given up at last.</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">I lay my cheek on mother&#8217;s. If there&#8217;s only one for me,</span><br />
     <span class="poem5">I&#8217;d rather have her, anyway, than the girl she used to be!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&#8217;s pretty good,&rdquo; said Amos critically. &ldquo;I like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before he could go on, a little crystal clock struck four. So Amos had to
fall a-rhyming again. He stood on his head and illustrated the last two
lines of the rhyme.</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;I like to have vacation,</span><br />
       <span class="poem2">I like to camp and roam;</span><br />
     <span class="poem1">But mostly, in a curious way,</span><br />

<p>As the travelers entered the woods, they heard funny little clicking
sounds everywhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s the sound a watch makes when you shut it,&rdquo; Ann said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they have watches here instead of clocks,&rdquo; remarked Amos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said a voice behind them. The voice came from a fat Brownie,
who was sitting on a stone with his legs dangling. &ldquo;They have clocks
everywhere in Zodiac Town,&rdquo; the Brownie resumed, &ldquo;even out here in the
suburbs. That noise is the Chestnut Chaps unbuckling their belts and
throwing off their overcoats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children looked as if they did not know whether he was serious or
joking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s the honest truth,&rdquo; said the Brownie. &ldquo;Listen.</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Every little wing of wind,</span><br />
       <span class="poem1">Every tilt of breeze,</span><br />

     <span class="poem">Watch and wait a moment, child&mdash;</span><br />
       <span class="poem1">It&#8217;s the Chestnut Chaps!</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;Elbow crowding elbow hard</span><br />

     <span class="poem">Never finer fellows lived</span><br />
       <span class="poem1">Than the Chestnut Chaps!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>As he finished, there came a series of clicks overhead, and seven Chestnut
Chaps landed suddenly at the travelers&#8217; very feet. As they fell, two gray
squirrels darted out to the end of a limb, their tails jerking with
excitement; but the Brownie waved them back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this wood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;squirrels are not allowed to feed on chestnuts.&rdquo;
He turned to the squirrels,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> who were scowling at him from a high branch.
&ldquo;And you know that very well,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>The squirrels merely looked sulky, and so the Brownie addressed himself to
Amos. &ldquo;What,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;is your candid opinion about the wood-folk,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wood-folk?&rdquo; Amos said. He had not known that he had any opinion about
the wood-folk, but just then a clock struck four, and suddenly he formed
an opinion on the spot.</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;The wood-folk scamper to and fro;</span><br />
       <span class="poem1">They have no tasks to do.</span><br />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;The wood-folk frolic everywhere,</span><br />

     <span class="poem">And yet, for all this woodland joy,</span><br />
     <span class="poem">Who would not rather be a boy?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, everyone to his taste,&rdquo; remarked an odd-looking elf, who appeared
suddenly from nowhere in particular. &ldquo;For my part, I prefer to be just
exactly what I am. Once a witch changed me into a boy for ten minutes, and
I give you my word I never was so uncomfortable in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are witches <em>here</em>?&rdquo; cried Ann, as she fixed her big eyes on the elf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the elf and the Brownie briskly, in one breath. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t
you have witches up your way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only at Hallowe&#8217;en,&rdquo; Amos told them.</p>

<p>The elf looked thoughtful. &ldquo;Oh, at Hallowe&#8217;en,&rdquo; he said. Then his eyes
began to twinkle, and he spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Amos and Ann looked at the Journeying Man. &ldquo;It must be very hard on her,
J. M.,&rdquo; they said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s hard on her?&rdquo; returned J. M. &ldquo;Having turkey and potatoes and all
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amos and Ann turned red. &ldquo;Having no one to eat them,&rdquo; they said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>It had been some hours since they left the gypsy camp, and they were
beginning to be very hungry indeed.</p>

<p>The little old lady stood at the door and waited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might help her out if there&#8217;s time,&rdquo; J. M. said suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; cried Amos. &ldquo;There&#8217;s plenty of that, you know, in Zodiac Town!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two minutes later they were seated round the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s like Thanksgiving,&rdquo; Ann said in delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just think&mdash;&rdquo; J. M. replied&mdash;</p>

<p>The old lady was delighted with all this rhyming, and on the spur of the
moment she made up a very good rhyme of her own. Amos and Ann thought it
was the best of all that they had heard that day&mdash;and goodness knows they
had heard a great many!</p>

<p>The children had a glorious time at the December house. There was a
beautiful tree there, all lighted and ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can&#8217;t take the things off, you know,&rdquo; one Christmas child told
Amos and Ann, &ldquo;until somebody says a rhyme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A clock chimed two a minute later, and caught Amos in the middle of a
sentence, at the words, &ldquo;it was.&rdquo; So he went on and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like that poem, Amos,&rdquo; said Ann, &ldquo;though I must say I don&#8217;t know how
you found out all that.&rdquo; Then she asked the little Christmas girl to
repeat a poem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know one about a different kind of Christmas tree,&rdquo; the little girl
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a prettier tree than this one here in the room&mdash;surely!&rdquo; cried Amos
and Ann.</p>

<p>The Christmas child reflected. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;prettier, in a way, than
this&mdash;because it was such a surprise. Listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she told them about it.</p>

    <p><span class="poem">&ldquo;A little bird told a squirrel,</span><br />

<p>Just as the last gift was handed down, the last candles went suddenly out,
and, at the same time, clocks began to strike all over the house.</p>

<p>The Journeying Man picked up his stick. &ldquo;Time to go to bed!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>Amos and Ann were astonished. &ldquo;To bed?&rdquo; they repeated, unbelieving. &ldquo;To
bed, in Zodiac Town?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, in your own home,&rdquo; replied J. M. &ldquo;Come along, Amos and Ann!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when they still held back, he gave them a funny little scolding all in
rhyme, which pleased them so that they followed him out into the dusk with
never a word!</p>

ground. But all at once a clock began to strike fast and furiously. It had

    <p style="margin-left: 10em">They traveled on till they came in sight<br />

    (Just as the voice called, &ldquo;Twenty-four!&rdquo;).<br />
    &ldquo;Why, <em>this</em> wasn&#8217;t hard!&rdquo; said they.<br />
    They stared at the poem and hung their heads&mdash;<br />
    &ldquo;Why did we run away?&rdquo;<br />
    They said to each other, &ldquo;It seems sometimes<br />
    There really is lots of good in rhymes.&rdquo;</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10em">&ldquo;Perhaps it would be a very good plan<br />
    To study them more,&rdquo; said wise little Ann.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10em">And Amos answered: &ldquo;I&#8217;m going to know<br />
    Whole pages up and down,<br />
    Then find J. M., in a hurry, and go<br />
    Straight back to Zodiac Town.&rdquo;</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10em">They fled upstairs like swift little hares,<br />
    And burrowed into their beds,<br />
    With numberless tunes and rhythms and runes<br />
    A-ringing in their heads.<br />
    And they dreamed all night of a scallopy road<br />
    And of clocks with a curious chime,<br />
    And talked in their sleep&mdash;and every word<br />
    Was a rhyme, a rhyme, a rhyme!</p>
